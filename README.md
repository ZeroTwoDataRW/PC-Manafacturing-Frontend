Amaterasu Site
Website Development Project: PC Hardware E-commerce Site

I created a responsive website using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to simulate an e-commerce platform for a company selling PC hardware components and pre-built PCs.

Please note that this website is solely developed on the front-end and does not have functioning back-end features such as cart, search, and contact form submissions.

In the future, I plan to enhance this website by implementing back-end functionality to enable full interactivity and data processing.

Your valuable comments and suggestions to enhance the website are highly appreciated. Thank you!

Please access the website through the following link:
